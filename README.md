## 📎 Assignment Answers

### Q1. GitHub Link of an AI/ML Project
This repository IS the project!  
🔗 https://github.com/priyadubey7744-dev/ragchatpdf/tree/fd874e37ee9f644ccc7b090f16b07cb5f6032720

**What it does:**
- Upload any PDF document
- Ask questions about it
- AI answers using only that document (no hallucination)
- Built using RAG architecture + Groq LLM (Llama3)

### Q2. How to Evaluate if Candidate Answer is Correct in an AI Mock Interview Agent

I would use 3 methods combined:

**1. LLM-as-Judge:**
Pass the question + candidate answer + ideal answer to an LLM
with a scoring rubric. Ask it to rate 1–10 on correctness,
depth, and clarity.

**2. Semantic Similarity:**
Convert candidate answer and ideal answer into embeddings,
then measure cosine similarity. High similarity = good answer.

**3. Key Concept Check:**
For technical questions, verify that must-have concepts
are mentioned in the answer.

Example code:
```python
def evaluate_answer(question, candidate_answer, role):
    prompt = f"""
    You are interviewing for {role}.
    Question: {question}
    Answer: {candidate_answer}
    Score 1-10 and explain why. Return JSON.
    """
    return llm.invoke(prompt)
```

### Q3. What is RAG and How to Use it in an Interview Agent

**RAG = Retrieval-Augmented Generation**

Simple explanation:
Imagine an LLM is a smart student who read many books
but doesn't know YOUR specific content.
RAG gives the LLM a "cheat sheet" of relevant information
at the time of answering — so it gives accurate answers
instead of guessing.

**How RAG works:**
1. Store documents as vectors in a database
2. User asks a question
3. System finds the most similar chunks (retrieval)
4. Chunks are injected into the LLM prompt (augmentation)
5. LLM generates a grounded answer (generation)

**In an Interview Agent, RAG can:**
- Store ideal answers → retrieve closest one to evaluate responses
- Pull role-specific questions from a question bank
- Give personalized feedback by comparing weak answers
  to strong reference answers

**This project demonstrates RAG:**
- PDF is chunked and stored as TF-IDF vectors
- User question → semantic search → top 4 chunks retrieved
- Chunks injected into Groq LLM → grounded answer generated

## 🧠 How RAG Works (Simple Explanation)

**Problem:** LLMs don't know about your specific document.

**RAG Solution:**
1. **Split** the document into small chunks
2. **Store** chunks as vectors (mathematical representations)
3. When you ask a question, **find** the most similar chunks
4. **Inject** those chunks into the LLM prompt as context
5. LLM **answers** based only on that context → no hallucination

**Why this matters:** The LLM doesn't need to be retrained on your data. RAG is faster, cheaper, and keeps answers up-to-date.
